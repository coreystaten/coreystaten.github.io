I am a programmer/mathematician from Columbus, Ohio.  I received my PhD in Mathematics from The Ohio State University in August of 2018; my thesis and accompanying code are available [here](https://github.com/coreystaten/CatComputad).

I'm currently looking for work; my resume is [here](/assets/corey-staten-resume.pdf) (updated 2019-01-04).

I recently finished a grant from [the Machine Intelligence Research Institute](https://intelligence.org/) to get up to speed with deep reinforcement learning.  Here are some of the of algorithms I implemented:

[**Rainbow: deep Q-network variants**](https://github.com/coreystaten/deeprl-rainbow)

[![Rainbow performance graph for Pong](/assets/rainbow.png)](https://github.com/coreystaten/deeprl-rainbow)

[**Proximal policy optimization**](https://github.com/coreystaten/deeprl-ppo)

Reinforcement learning algorithms have a reputation for being finicky to implement and debug; I wrote some notes on the problems I encountered while implementing PPO which you can view here.
