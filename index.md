I'm a programmer/mathematician from Columbus, Ohio.  I received my PhD in Mathematics from The Ohio State University in August of 2018, then immediately stopped thinking about pure math and got into ML/Data Science instead.

I'm currently Director of Innovation at Sixgill LLC, where I work primarily on deep learning computer vision models and infrastructure.  You can check out my LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/corey-staten-a79b39175/) (updated 2021-02-02).

## Other Stuff

In Summer of 2018, I received a grant from [the Machine Intelligence Research Institute](https://intelligence.org/) to get up to speed with deep reinforcement learning.  Here are some of the of algorithms I implemented:
