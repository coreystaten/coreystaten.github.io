I am a programmer/mathematician from Columbus, Ohio.  I received my PhD in Mathematics from The Ohio State University in August of 2018; my thesis and accompanying code are available [here](https://github.com/coreystaten/CatComputad).

I recently finished a grant from [the Machine Intelligence Research Institute](https://intelligence.org/) to get up to speed with deep reinforcement learning.  You can view some of my implementations of Deep RL algorithms [here](https://github.com/coreystaten/deeprl-rainbow) and [here](https://github.com/coreystaten/deeprl-ppo).

I'm currently looking for work in AI safety engineering or related areas; my resume is [here](/assets/corey-staten-resume.pdf) (updated 2018-10-01).

Reinforcement learning algorithms have a reputation for being finicky to implement and debug; I wrote some notes on the problems I encountered while implementing PPO which you can view here.
